He was the older brother of one of the coeds. He was staying with her at campus housing and he liked sleeping with her roommates. His name is Patrick Cassidy. He was sleeping with both Bethany and Maya. His sister’s name is Carly.</p><p>Carly’s boyfriend never liked Patrick. He thought he was an overly proud jerk. He got a bad feeling off him and he tried to warn Bethany and Maya’s parents about him. Only the dads surprised him. They came rushing into the girls’ room. They tried to assault Patrick. They even pulled a gun on him and he was fighting with one of them when it went off.</p><p>Patrick committed murder. It wasn’t his fault, but he decided not to stick around to defend himself and so he went on the run. He also took Bethany and Maya hostage. His sister saw him force Bethany into coming with him by pointing a gun at her only she still chose to defend him. Patrick was Carly’s only family member.</p><p>Their parents died. They grew up in the foster system. Carly didn’t want to lose him and that’s why she purposely overlooked his behavior. She missed the signs. Her boyfriend didn’t.</p><p>Patrick was trying to start a cult. Its why he stayed on campus for two months. He was hoping to find barely legal girls who wanted to lash out against their upbring and who would follow him anywhere. Patrick just got out of prison six months ago. He was a violent ex-con who had taken two girls hostage. He had Maya brainwashed.</p><p>It was her father that he killed and she still chose to be devoted to him. Bethany was a different story. Bethany wanted out and Patrick forced her to come with him because he found her more of a challenge.</p><p>Maya was rebelling against her dad who had a temper. Bethany, however, was from a privileged home where she was put in a gilded cage. Maya went running to Patrick. It was Bethany that had needed to be convinced and she wanted out right after she saw him assault her dad. She even called her mom to check on her dad after she had gotten kidnapped.</p><p>Patrick found her with the phone and he chose to punish her. He slapped her around. He broke her phone. He also threatened to kill her now that she’s proven she wasn’t devoted to him. And so Bethany pretended she was.</p><p>Bethany was a smart girl. She knew they would kill her if she didn’t go along with them. She did everything she could to talk Patrick down from hurting her and somewhere along the way – she lost herself. She allowed him to burn her with an iron to prove her loyalty. She saw a chance for her to escape when they went to go rob a gun store and rather than run – she helped them rob the place. She let the power of holding a gun go to her head. She was so happy to no longer be the good girl that she became a willing participate to Patrick’s crimes.</p><p>Why did Patrick need a bunch of guns? He already had the two girls. He was supposed to meet up with his sister and she was going to get him the guns, but she got caught by the FBI. They arrested her for being an accessory. They tried to get her to turn against her brother. Only she said she would do anything for family. Patrick was her only family. Their parents died when they were really small. They have no memories of them and so that’s why Patrick was willing to do all of this. He was trying to recreate a family.</p><p>He was just too stunted to understand what a real family would look like. He wanted a family that would follow him anywhere and everywhere. One that would never question him or his intelligence. He wanted to be God to them. Patrick rewarded Bethany after she helped them rob a gun store. They all three slept together. The other two also decided to give her more responsibilities. They gave her own gun when they later went to go rob a bank. They stole a lot of money. Enough to start over somewhere. This was why they needed the guns and Patrick’s reign of terror was far from over.</p><p>They robbed another bank. They shot someone at the second bank and they were using unknown cars. They got their first car from Patrick’s old cellmate. They then traded that car for another one. They also have been using Ubers. The FBI was always one step behind them and so they knew one of the girls was pregnant by finding a thrown away pregnancy test. It’s probably why Patrick stayed so long in their dorms. He wanted to get them pregnant and have a kid of his own. He wanted a family. He was going to get one, but the feds did figure out the next bank he was going to hit and they were there waiting for them.</p><p>They shot Patrick in the arm. He’ll live and they got the girls to put down their guns in exchange for medical attention for Patrick. But neither girl is willing to admit which is pregnant. And they were too brainwashed to be treated as victims, they were accomplices.</p><p>But Hana started an online chat with a guy. She pretended to be thirteen to lure him into a trap. She collected evidence against him and then she outted him to his family as a pedophile.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnlpe2brnOrKtmr5GjwaawjKucnJmgYn11eZBqZGtrXaiyor%2FOp2RtZZWltrS7w55kam9dqbWmecyiqp6cpZiutbXOp2Sonl2isrWvwKWdZmpf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./h%C3%A9ctor-elizondo-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Hctor Elizondo Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>

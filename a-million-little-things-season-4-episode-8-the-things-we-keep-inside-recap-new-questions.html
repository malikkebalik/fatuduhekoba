Fans also find out precisely what’s going on with the Regina (Christina Moses) — Rome (Romany Malco) — Cassandra (Azie Tesfai) love triangle. Plus, Sophie Dixon (Lizzy Greene) has that long-awaited MMI audition, and we get another glimpse at life in&nbsp;<a href=#>France with Delilah</a>&nbsp;(Stephanie Szostak) and Danny Dixon (Chance Hurstfield).</p><p id=par-2_20><strong>[Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers from A Million Little Things Season 4 Episode 8 ‘The Things We Keep Inside.’]</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/A-Million-Little-Things-Season-4-episode-8-promo.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rome-and-cassandra-or-rome-and-regina-the-love-triangle-continues><strong>Rome and Cassandra or Rome and Regina: the love triangle continues</strong></h2><p id=par-3_92>When&nbsp;A Million Little Things&nbsp;Season 4 Episode 8 opens, Regina tries to initiate sex with Rome, but he answers a phone call from his publicist,&nbsp;<a href=#>Cassandra</a>, instead. After preparing a full breakfast, Regina jokingly suggests that the publicist has a crush on Rome. However, he becomes very defensive, which makes Regina wonder if he’s having an affair. During Sophie’s audition at MMI, Regina asks Eddie Saville (David Giuntoli) why he had an affair with Delilah. He admits that something was missing in his relationship with Katherine Kim (Grace Park) and his attraction to Delilah.</p><p id=par-4_68>Later, after the meeting with PBS goes very well, Cassandra asks Rome to celebrate with champagne. Rome tells Cassandra what Gina said, and it turns out that his wife was right. Cassandra does have a crush on him, and she believes he’s not happily married. However, he’s not interested in cheating on Regina. He heads home and tells Regina what’s bothering him — his depression is back.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/A-Million-Little-Things-next-episode.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-million-little-things-season-4-episode-8-recap-gary-has-two-unexpected-visitors><strong>‘A Million Little Things’ Season 4 Episode 8 recap: Gary has two unexpected visitors</strong></h2><p id=par-5_92>After explaining to Eddie that it’s time to get rid of all things Darcy (Floriana Lima), Gary (James Roday Rodriguez) has two unexpected visitors that bring him right back to thinking about his ex-girlfriend. First, he finds Liam (Mattia Castrillo) at his apartment in&nbsp;A Million Little Things&nbsp;Season 4 Episode 8. Luckily, the young boy opens up about why he ran away from home. He hates Lenox and feels like “everything is about the baby now.” When his father (Darcy’s husband),&nbsp;<a href=#>Stephen (Derek Richardson)</a>, comes to get him, Liam locks himself in Gary’s bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_146>However, Gary explains to Stephen what Liam said, and the father coaxes Liam into coming back home. Stephen explains that the fall that Darcy had (which put her on bed rest) was in no way Liam’s fault and that he is very much needed at home. Gary also gives Stephen a pep talk about his marriage with Darcy. Gary insists that Darcy broke up with him because she wanted to give things another try with Stephen. We all know that’s a lie, but as usual, Gary puts his friends above himself. It also looks like Gary hasn’t learned that lying isn’t the way to go. Then Gary gives his lucky Bruins hat to Liam, who truly misses his friend. Later as he finishes putting away his memories of Darcy, he finds a post-it note from Maggie. It says, “I’m in,” and then coincidentally, she calls him.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maggie-finds-out-who-her-stalker-is-in-a-million-little-things-season-4-episode-8><strong>Maggie finds out who her stalker is in ‘A Million Little Things’ Season 4 Episode 8</strong></h2><p id=par-7_81>When&nbsp;A Million Little Things&nbsp;Season 4 Episode 8 opens, Maggie assumes that her stalker is the person in possession of Justin’s journals. She explains what happened to her former client to her boyfriend,&nbsp;<a href=#>Camden Lamoureux (Ryan Hansen)</a>. He was a student at an art institute when Maggie counseled him. However, Justin developed feelings for his therapist. When Maggie tried to talk through those feelings with Justin, her client stopped coming. A few months later, Maggie found out that he had died by suicide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/A-Million-Little-Things-Season-4-Maggie-Bloom.jpg><p id=par-8_66>While taking phone calls for her radio talk show, Justin’s mother calls to express her anger and frustration. Maggie tries to help her, but her supervisor,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jane Goodman (Stephnie Weir),</a>&nbsp;cuts the call off and later reprimands her. The company policy states that she should end the call if it is a personal attack. Jane takes Maggie off the air for one week to let things calm down.</p><p id=par-9_65>Instead of going with her boyfriend to his next game, Maggie decides to visit Albany to talk to Justin’s mother. However, Cam makes her promise to leave if the woman does not want to speak. Then they share a sweet moment with a real “I love you.” The relationship seems to be going well, but Gary offers to join Maggie on her trek to Albany.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sophie-auditions-for-mmi><strong>Sophie auditions for MMI</strong></h2><p id=par-10_60>Also, in&nbsp;A Million Little Things&nbsp;Season 4 Episode 8, Sophie plays her MMI audition song for Eddie and admits that Peter’s wife, Anna Benoit (Erin Karpluk), inspired the song. Sophie channels her feelings about what Peter (Andrew Leeds) took from her to play the music. Eddie admits that he won’t see Anna again because “if it starts messy, it stays messy.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-11_93>Later while they await the audition, Regina praises Sophie for having the courage to return to the place she met Peter. Before she sings her emotional piece of music, Sophie has several flashbacks of her time with Peter. However, the memories don’t hold her back but give her fuel for her audition. Sophie gets into MMI (a prestigious and exclusive music school), and the first person she wants to tell is Anna. Peter’s wife congratulates her and admits she also went to MMI for violin, but “someone” convinced her she wasn’t good enough.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_59>Later, Sophie calls Danny and Delilah in France for a brief conversation. Delilah doesn’t appear at all. Sophie admits that MMI isn’t her dream anymore. Instead, she meets up with her new friend,&nbsp;<a href=#>Morgan (Clara Alexandrova)</a>, to audition as their bass player.&nbsp;Plus, Sophie sets up a date for Eddie with Anna. She doesn’t think it’s a problem that they date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-burning-questions-we-still-have-after-a-million-little-things-season-4-episode-8>Burning questions we still have after <strong>‘A Million Little Things’ Season 4 Episode 8</strong></h2><p id=par-13_56>Will Gary and Maggie get back together in A Million Little Things Season 4?

Founded in Georgia in 2008, members are rappers Takeoff, Offset and Quavo. In touring years they can be among the highest-earning entertainers in hip-hop. For example, between September 2017 and September 2018 they earned a combined $25 million thanks largely to 93 live shows during that period. Tragically, group member Takeoff was murdered in November 2022.</p><h2 id=founding-early-career><strong>Founding and Early Career</strong></h2><p>Migos was formed in 2008 by <a href=#>Quavo</a> (born Quavious Keyate Marshall), <a href=#>Takeoff</a> (born Kirshnik Khari Ball), and <a href=#>Offset</a> (born Kiari Kendrell Cephus). The three members are actually all related; Quavo and Offset are cousins, and Takeoff is Quavo's nephew. They were raised together in Gwinnett County, suburban Atlanta.</p><p>Originally, they called their group the Polo Club. After changing their name to Migos in 2010, they released their first full-length project, the mixtape "Juug Season," in August 2011, following it up with the mixtape "No Label" in June 2012.</p><h2 id=breakthrough><strong>Breakthrough</strong></h2><p>Their breakthrough came in 2013, when their single "Versace" (produced by Zaytoven) peaked at number 99 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Canadian rapper <a href=# title="Drake Net Worth">Drake</a> boosted their recognition when he remixed the song, adding his own verse, and performing it at the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival. "Versace" was rereleased as the lead single on their mixtape "Y.R.N. (Young Rich Niggas" in June 2013, which received a positive critical reception. SPIN named "Y.R.N." the 27th-best album of 2013, and 6th-best hip-hop album of 2013. "Versace" also landed on several year-end best-of lists, including XXL's "The 25 Best Songs of 2013," Complex's "The 50 Best Songs of 2013," SPIN's "50 Best Songs of 2013," and Rolling Stone's "The 100 Best Songs of 2013."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-248434 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Migos.jpg alt="Migos Net Worth" width=594 height=413 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-248434 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=achieving-success><strong>Achieving Success</strong></h2><p>Migos released the mixtape "No Label 2" in February 2014, as a sequel to their second mixtape.

It peaked at number 34 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. An incident at Georgia Southern University in April 2015, where members of the group and their entourage were arrested during a concert at the school, pushed their album release back. Charges included Possession of a Schedule II Controlled Substance, Possession of Marijuana, and for Offset, Possession of a Firearm in a School Safety Zone and Possession of a Firearm during the Commission of a Crime. Offset's previous felony conviction exacerbated the situation, and he ended up getting incarcerated.</p><p>Migos' debut album "Yung Rich Nation" was released in July 2015 with Offset still in jail, clocking it at number 3 on the Top Rap Albums Chart its first week. They continued to release music despite Offset's incarceration, releasing the mixtapes "Back to the Bando" (September 2015) and "Streets on Lock 4" (October 2015) with Rich the Kid. Following Offset's release from prison in December 2015, they released "Young Rich Niggas 2" in January 2016.</p><p>Their October 2015 single "Look at My Dab" is often credited as having helped popularize the dance move commonly known as "dabbing," alongside other public figures such as Odell Beckham Jr. and <a href=# title="Cam Newton Net Worth">Cam Newton</a>.</p><p>Their second studio album "Culture" was released in January 2017, followed by "Culture II" in January 2018.

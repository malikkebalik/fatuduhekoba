Unfortunately, at the time of his death he owed over $3.5 million in taxes. More information on his financial state towards the end of his life in the next section below. Redd Foxx was best known for starring in the television series "Sanford and Son" and for his explicit comedy albums. Redd Foxx passed away from a heart attack on October 11, 1991 at the age of 68.</p><p>He gained fame as a raunchy nightclub act in the 1950s and 1960s. Foxx was named the "King of the Party Records," and appeared on over 50 records during his career. In 2004 he was named the 24th best stand-up comedian by Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.</p><p>Foxx starred as Fred G. Sanford in the television series "Sanford and Son" from 1972 to 1977 and in the TV series "Sanford" from 1980 to 1981. As we detail in a moment, Redd's Sanford and Son salary made him the highest paid actor on TV for a number of years. heIn 1986 he starred as Al Hughes in the television series "The Red Foxx Show."</p><p>He won a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Actor â€“ Musical/Comedy for Sanford and Son and was nominated for three others. Foxx also won two Image Awards and was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards.</p><h2 id=financial-problems><strong>Financial Problems</strong></h2><p>Foxx's divorces were very costly, in addition to Foxx's tendency towards living a lavish lifestyle and poor financial management. In 1983, he filed for bankruptcy and the IRS filed multiple tax liens against Foxx's property in an attempt to make up back income taxes he owed. His Las Vegas home was seized in 1989, along with seven of his vehicles. At the time of his death in 1991, Foxx's estate was in debt to the IRS to the tune of $3.5 million.</p><h2 id=sanford-son-salary-dispute data-sourcepos=9:1-9:159><strong>Sanford and Son Salary Dispute</strong></h2><p>In the middle of taping episodes for the 1973-1974 season, Redd Foxx walked off the show, citing health issues but really it was a salary dispute. Writers wrote his character off for that season's six remaining episodes.</p><p>Up to that point Redd Foxx was earning $19,000 per episode. There were 24 or 25 episodes per season in seasons 2-6. Earning $19,000 per episode in 1973 is the same as earning $130,000 per episode today. It worked out to around $500,000 per year, roughly $3.5 million in today's dollars.</p><p>The show's production company fought back with a $10 million lawsuit, but the issue was eventually resolved. In the resolution, Redd's salary was increased to $25,000 per episode AND he was given a 25% cut of producers' net profits. The deal made him the highest-paid actor on television at the time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356763 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Redd-Foxx.jpg alt width=900 height=608 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356763 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Foxx was born on December 9, 1922 and given the name John Elroy Sanford.

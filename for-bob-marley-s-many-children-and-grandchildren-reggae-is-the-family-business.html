Norval Marley, a nearly 60-year-old white <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>naval officer</a> who was overseeing plantations in the area for the British government. Marley said he was often <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>bullied</a> for his biracial heritage growing up and derogatorily referred to as "White Boy."</p><p>The Jamaican reggae artist has been credited with making Jamaican music more popular worldwide. His professional career first began with the band the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>Teenagers</a> — eventually renamed the Wailers — which he formed with Peter Tosh and Bunny Waller. Their debut album <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>featured</a> the single "One Love," which Marley continued to revisit throughout his career. After signing to Island Records, the band was renamed Bob Marley and the Wailers, and their star power continued to grow, even after Tosh and Waller left the band.</p><p>Marley became a sensation with recordings of songs like "No Woman, No Cry" and "<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>I Shot the Sheriff</a>," which was later covered by Eric Clapton. In 1976, he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>survived</a> an assassination attempt, when gunmen entered Marley's home two days before he was slated to perform at "Smile Jamaica," a concert set to take place days before a snap election in the country. Because of rising tensions at the time, some saw the concert as being politically motivated. Marley suffered minor wounds to his chest and arm.</p><p>His career was cut short. Marley died of melanoma that spread from his toe in 1981 at the age of 36, leaving behind his wife, Rita, and at least 11 children. He was buried <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>along with</a> his red Gibson Les Paul guitar and a Bible. In a eulogy, then-Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga called Marley "part of the collective consciousness of the nation." His greatest hits album "Legend" — which was released posthumously — remains the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>best-selling</a> reggae album of all time, and Marley still ranks among the best-selling musicians of all time.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Rita Marley</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Rita Marley performing at the Ritz in New York City on October 4, 1982. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Ebet Roberts/Redferns via Getty Images</span></span></figure><p>Bob and Rita Marley married in 1966. Rita, born Alfarita Constantia Anderson, was born in 1946 in Cuba and was raised in Kingston, Jamaica. In the 1960s, Rita joined a group called the Soulettes, a trio that was mentored by Bob Marley. After they married, Rita often sang vocals with the Wailers.</p><p>In 1976, Rita <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>survived</a> a shot to the head in the assassination attempt two days prior to the "Smile Jamaica" concert. That same year, Rita <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>moved</a> to London with Marley, who had begun seeing model Cindy Breakspeare, who had just been crowned Miss World.

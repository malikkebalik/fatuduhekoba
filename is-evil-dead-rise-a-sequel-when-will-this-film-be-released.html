When Will This Film Be Released?</h1><div id=sub-header>September 2024 · 6 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Is Evil Dead Rise a Sequel? </strong>The majority of fans of the series have long anticipated Evil Dead Rise. Without including The Evil Dead, we may lose all credibility when asked to debate and name the top horror films of all time. When Sam Raimi’s first DIY tutorial debuted in 1981, it quickly established itself as a genre game-changer, and its 1987 sequel, Evil Dead II, may be even more beloved than its predecessor.</p><p>Army Of Darkness the third episode was out in 1992 and continued the comedy in a new setting. In 2013, thanks to filmmaker Fede Alvarez, the Evil Dead remake was released. Fans praised it as one of the best horror remakes to appear in years, stripping away all humor and upping the carnage.</p><h2><strong>Is Evil Dead Rise a Sequel?</strong></h2><p>In contrast to the 2013 version, Evil Dead Rise is somewhat of a continuation of the original trilogy. The new picture, which includes references to the classics, expands upon the mythos of the original films rather than being a remake. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>GamesRadar</a>, director Lee Cronin recently discussed the film’s place in the franchise with Total Film:</p><p>“There’s no Ash in this story and no cabin in the woods; they’re two iconic elements of what Evil Dead is. But the movie does include the book and an extraordinary amount of vicious, malevolent Deadites, so I was always pretty comfortable making that move [to LA].”</p><p>The transition from the log cabin in the woods to the high-rise Los Angeles apartment complex is the one he alludes to. Although it is a radical departure from what viewers might have anticipated from a new film, the trailer has shown that it also contains much of the original’s DNA.</p><h2>When Will Evil Dead Rise Be Released?</h2><p>Initially intended for HBO Max, “Evil Dead Rise” experienced an amusing incident on its route to the streaming service. One: After taking over Warner Bros., David Zaslav decided to prioritize theatrical releases.</p><p><strong>You can also read about these entertainment shows:</strong></p><p>Two: According to Deadline, the audience gobbled up the movie’s unreleased trailer when it was shown at the trade event CineEurope, demonstrating that it was worthy of being shown in theaters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Is-Evil-Dead-Rise-a-Sequel-1.jpg><p>When may we anticipate standing in line and purchasing tickets (if our possessed hands don’t rebel)? <strong>The release date for “Evil Dead” Rise has been set for April 21, 2023, according to a tweet from<a href=# rel=noopener> Bruce Campbell</a>.</strong> The actor also posted a first-look image from the movie, which depicted a smirking Deadite sneering through a blood-spattered apartment doorway.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that “Evil Dead Rise” won’t be the only horror comedy that month when it debuts in 2023. The movie will be up against “Renfield,” which stars Nicholas Hoult as the title character and Nicolas Cage as Renfield’s boss, Dracula. What will be intriguing to watch is which horror comedy emerges as the winner.</p><h2><strong>What is the Plot of Evil Dead Rise?</strong></h2><p>One thing has remained the same throughout the “Evil Dead” series: someone reading a lousy book, most frequently the Necronomicon, which then releases the forces of hell. In the first two “Evil Dead” films, a group of young people is picked off one by one and taken over by savage demons as this horror show plays out in a cabin in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Of course, the main distinction between the two movies is that “Evil Dead II” is a masterful horror-comedy whereas “The Evil Dead” is a pure horror movie. In “Army of Darkness,” the franchise’s protagonist Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) travels back to battle a skeleton army. In 2013’s “Evil Dead,” a group of friends trying to assist a lady in overcoming her drug habit decide to hide out in a cabin and unleash the Deadites, and things get even gorier.</p><p>But what will be the subject of “Evil Dead Rise”? Will it stick to the tried-and-true “Evil Dead” model of a lodge in the woods or take a more original approach like “Army of Darkness”? The Deadites are traveling to Los Angeles this time and intend to devastate an apartment building.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Witness the mother of all evil in the official trailer for Evil Dead Rise – only in theaters April 21. <a href=# rel=noopener>#EvilDeadRise</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CMtitMZumK</a></p><p>— Evil Dead (@EvilDead) <a href=# rel=noopener>January 4, 2023</a></p><p>As the official synopsis reads (via Fangoria), “In the fifth ‘Evil Dead’ film, a road-weary Beth pays an overdue visit to her older sister Ellie, who is raising three kids on her own in a cramped L.A. apartment. The sisters’ reunion is cut short by the discovery of a mysterious book deep in the bowels of Ellie’s building, giving rise to flesh-possessing demons and thrusting Beth into an early battle for survival as she is faced with the most nightmarish version of motherhood imaginable.”</p><h2><strong>Who is Starring in Evil Dead Rise?</strong></h2><p>The shotgun-toting, chainsaw-wielding Ash Williams, played by the one and only Bruce Campbell, served as the franchise’s focal point in the first three “Evil Dead” movies and the Starz series “Ash vs. Evil Dead.” The 2013 film moved the focus to Mia, played by Jane Levy, a heroin addict who must contend with an attack from hell when she attempts to quit cold turkey.</p><p>Who will be in charge of “Evil Dead Rise” then? Lily Sullivan will play the lead role of Beth, a single mother who visits her sister and finds herself in an apartment building filled with Deadites, according to /the film. Sullivan might have appeared in movies or miniseries like “Mental” or “Picnic at Hanging Rock.”</p><p>Alyssa Sutherland will play Ellie, a mother of three who resides in the apartment mentioned above a building opposite her. Ellie’s life becomes even more complicated when the flesh-bound Necronomicon appears. Sutherland’s portrayal of Queen Aslaug on the television series “Vikings” is undoubtedly what most “Vikings” viewers associate her with.</p><p><strong>Also, check out our latest articles:</strong></p><h2><strong>Is There a Trailer for Evil Dead Rise?</strong></h2><p>Watch out if you’re at work. The “Evil Dead Rise” red band trailer doesn’t play around. The trailer opens with a possessed mother Ellie making the worst scrambled eggs ever while narrating a romantic dream in which she brutally murders her entire family. It is evident that reading the Necronomicon and listening to the frightening old album her kid discovered were errors.</p><p>From then, as Doris Day’s “Que Sera, Sera” plays in the background, we watch Deadites ingest glass shards, scalps being torn off of skulls, and our bloodied heroine Beth defending a bunch of underprivileged children from their very undead mother. We’re frightened to see what happens with the cheese grater, and yes, that “Evil Dead” mainstay, the chainsaw, does make a cameo, guaranteeing plenty of chopped limbs and blood sprays.</p><p></p><p><strong>Final Lines</strong></p><p>Evil Dead Rise is an upcoming American supernatural horror film written and directed by Lee Cronin.

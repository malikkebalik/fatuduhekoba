Celebrity</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>“Sutton’s ex-husband’s into hedge funds, who knows, like money stuff. When they divorced Sutton had no idea she’d be set for life. Because there are homes, private jets and I think there’s a baseball team. Or two.</p><p>Sutton married her childhood friend, Thibeault “Christian” Stracke, in 2000 and while they are divorced now, they had a marriage likely built on more than just loads of cash. Though to be fair, Christian is probably mostly to thank for their family’s wealth. He is the global head of credit research at PIMCO, an investment management company.</p><p>‘RHOBH’ star Sutton Stracke and former husband Christian Stracke (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) Even before being promoted to the position of a housewife, ‘Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’ star Sutton Stracke managed to grab everybody’s attention.</p><p>Who is Sutton’s wealthy ex-husband and what does he do? Sutton actually grew up with her ex-husband, Thibeault “Christian” Stracke, in Augusta, Georgia. The two reconnected later in life in NYC. They married in 2000 and have three children together. They divorced in 2016, and apparently, Sutton got quite a substantial settlement.</p><h2>Who is Sutton Stracke?</h2><p>Sutton Stracke is<strong> a friend of the The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast, but not an official housewife.</strong> She was born and raised in Georgia and describes herself as a “a southern debutante-turned-Beverly Hills-socialite.”.</p><p>The socialite finally gave us a clue about the link between her luxurious lifestyle and her former marriage when cast member<strong> Garcelle Beauvais</strong> confronted her about it over dinner. When Beauvais asked where Stracke’s money came from, she confessed that she had been married to a man who “did well.”.</p><p>While Stracke has been tight-lipped about her past, she’s revealing more about her life and her mysterious wealth with every episode of<strong> Season 10.</strong> But one big part of Stracke’s story is still missing: her ex-husband.</p><p>Stracke’s ex is the global head of credit research at investment company PIMCO and holds an undergraduate degree from the<strong> University of Chicago.</strong></p><h2>Why is Sutton only a friend of the show? Does her ex have anything to do with it?</h2><p>Sutton has said that she thinks she was not allowed to be a “full” Real Housewife this season because<strong> she couldn’t show her full personal life but hopes to continue with the franchise and share the rest of her life with viewers.</strong> This has led to speculation that her ex-husband may have barred their children from being shown on the reality show.</p><p>He got his undergraduate degree from the<strong> University of Chicago</strong> and served in the Peace Corps as an agroforestry extension agent in Mauritania, West Africa. Sutton doesn’t have to worry about money for the rest of her life, but she’s using this time in her life as an opportunity to establish her own business endeavors.</p><p>Amelia Cunningham May 6, 2020 Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,<strong> Sutton Stracke.</strong> Current “friend” and possible future Housewife<strong> Sutton Stracke</strong> was introduced to Real Housewives of Beverly Hills with quite an impression. She brings Lisa Rinna to the NYC apartment of Domenico Dolce and reveals that Dolce and Gabbana send her a tiara every year …</p><p>They married in 2000 and have<strong> three</strong> children together. They divorced in 2016, and apparently Sutton got quite a substantial settlement. Christian Stracke has worked at PIMCO since 2008, where he is the Global Head of Credit Research and manages two funds.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2>Why does Sutton mention her ex on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills?</h2><p>Of course, Sutton is going to mention her ex<strong> because everyone knows just how nosy these women can be when it comes</strong> …</p><p>In an interview with ET, Sutton confirmed that she and her ex split in<strong> 2016</strong> and that she purchased the space for her clothing store soon after, seemingly implying that she used some of that divorce payout to kick start her dreams.</p><p>When<strong> Lisa Rinna</strong> introduced the newbie during the Season 10 premiere, she declared, “She’s rich, honey, she’s rich ,” as in she’s on a whole other level when compared to the rest of the cast. Lisa made that very clear when she said, “S he buys couture, and none of these other hoes do .”. And no, she wasn’t fronting.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmqq6spKS7tHnHrqqbmZ6ZeqW7jGpoam9pbHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-indiana-pacers-star-t-j-mcconnell-s-wife-valerie-guiliani.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Indiana Pacers Star T.J.

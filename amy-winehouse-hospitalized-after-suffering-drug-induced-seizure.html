Credit: Bauergriffinonline</p><p>Amy Winehouse looked to be sort-of recovering recently. She seemed to be a lot more sober and healthy-looking after a stint in hospital in late October, and <a href=#>emerged looking remarkably refreshed</a>. Then Amy’s husband Blake was released from prison to rehab in mid November, and <a href=#>she went on a rampage before his release</a>, freaking out in the street and banging on the door of her old apartment as if she expected him to be there.</p><p>Amy just admitted that her marriage with Blake is over and that he’s with the German model who was seen crying. It was thought that things might be looking up for her, like she could be ready to pick up her life and move on. Blake’s sentence was upheld by the court and he has to remain in rehab for 15 more months to serve out the remainder of his term. He won’t be able to see Amy other than on visits and if they’re through it could be easier for her to move on since he’s stuck in one place for a while.</p><p>Amy was rushed to the hospital yesterday after suffering a seizure that is thought to have been drug-induced. It wasn’t her first seizure from drugs. Her rep says it was due to prescription medication. The Sun claims she got in a fight with Blake over the phone and went on a bender:</p><p>The junkie diva, 25, was rushed to a London clinic after collapsing with a “seizure” during the bender.</p><p>Doctors performed a battery of tests – and were yesterday continuing to monitor her.</p><p>A source close to the troubled singer said of the phone bust-up with her hubby following his release from jail: “They had a screaming row. She was beside herself after the call – and she just totally lost it.”</p><p>As Amy recovered in hospital yesterday, her druggie husband, 26 – out on early release – failed to get a cut in his 27-month sentence for attacking a pub landlord and perverting justice by trying to cover it up.</p><p>A condition of being let out is that he completes the remainder of his term at a rehab clinic.</p><p>As he left London’s Court of Appeal, he said of his wife: “I’m in love with her.”</p><p>Amy is paying his £32,000 treatment fee but has not visited him. Pals claim she wants to sever ties.</p><p>One said: “While Blake was inside Amy looked like she was finally getting her life back together.”</p><p>Amy’s row over the phone on Saturday was followed by a bender that lasted until the next day.</p><p>The source said: “It didn’t stop until she was on the floor on Sunday. She has ended up in hospital a few times after similar drink and drugs related seizures. If she carries on, one of these incidents will be her last.”</p><p>Amy’s spokesman confirmed she was taken to hospital on Sunday but claimed she had “a bad reaction to the combination of medication she has currently been prescribed.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>The Sun</a>]</p><p>Maybe Blake heard that Amy said it was over and called her up proclaiming his love and trying to get her back. He may have messed with her head, and she turned to drugs again trying to cope. It’s a vicious cycle for that woman and I hope she can get out of it somehow for her sake. She’s already wasted years of her life that she’ll never get back. Hopefully she won’t be cutting her life short by decades.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i153.photobucket.com/albums/s218/celebitchy/amyfooter.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma2tmbYVwrcyylrChnpq1sMHSnpahp6OltrWty6KxnpyPlrO1sdGYqq6elpq%2FqrrGmJurrZditq%2Bw1JycnZejmra7wdGeZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./billionaire-jim-thompson-s-hong-kong-residence-latest-in-string-of-burglaries-in-wealthy-hk-neighbor.html>&#171;&nbsp;Billionaire Jim Thompson's Hong Kong Residence Latest In String Of Burglaries In Wealthy HK Neighbor</a>

She grew up with her six brothers and two sisters in St. Louis before her parents decided to move to Sacramento, California. The family lived there until 1975 when then moved to Tokyo, Japan following the divorce of her parents. Her mother remarried a man who was stationed at the Yokota Air Force Base in Japan and the family remained there for three years.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>While in Tokyo, Ray formed a song and dance group with two of her brothers and one sister called The Puppets. The group became quite popular in Japan and the landed a year-long performing contract at the Big Together Club in the Shinjuku District in Tokyo. The Puppets became increasingly popular in Japan, performing in cities throughout the country and appearing in television commercials. They were also offered a recording deal from CBS Records in Tokyo.</p><p>While performing with The Puppets, Ray also began modeling. She signed with Eddie Arab Modeling Agency and booked a number of jobs during the three years in which she lived in Japan. She appeared on the cover of several magazines and as a poster girl, in addition to appearing in commercials for Japanese department stores like Isetan, Matsuya, and Parco.</p><h2 id=playboy><strong>Playboy</strong></h2><p>In 1978, after three years in Japan, Ray and her family moved back to the United States. Ray decided to move to Los Angeles in order to continue pursuing her career in modeling and entertainment. She booked a few minor jobs here and there but became much more popular after booking a modeling job with "Playboy" in 1980. She was the Playmate of the Month for the June 1980 issue.</p><p>Her work with "Playboy" helped jumpstart Ray's career in the United States. She landed a contract with Johnson and Johnson to promote their Classy Curly products, which involved appearing in commercials and magazine advertisements for the product. In addition, she also appeared in advertisements for Coca Cola, Coors, McDonalds, and Leggs pantyhose, among other products.</p><p>Additionally, she appeared in the 1980 music video for the song "Give Me the Night" by George Benson.

In 1983, she appeared in the films "10 to Midnight" and "The Man Who Loved Women."</p><h2 id=thriller><strong>Thriller</strong></h2><p>Her major role in 1983 was in the music video for the song "Thriller" by Michael Jackson. In the video, she appeared as Michael's girlfriend.</p><p>Appearing with Ray was the first time that Jackson had interacted with a women in a video. <a href=#>John Landis</a>, the director of the video, encouraged Jackson to develop real chemistry with Ray, which subsequently came across in the resulting video.</p><p>Appearing in the video catapulted Ray to even greater fame, as it became one of the most popular music videos of all time and won the 1985 Grammy Award in the Best Video Album category, among other awards. However, in the following years, Ray complained that she was not receiving the royalties she had been promised from the video. She originally blamed Jackson for this but later apologized to him in 1997. The dispute was not settled though as Ray sued Jackson in May of 2009. Jackson died only two months later and Ray ended up settling with the Jackson estate in 2013 for a sum of $75,000.</p><h2 id=after-thriller><strong>After Thriller</strong></h2><p>Despite the troubles she would later face with Jackson over "Thriller," her appearance in the music video did help Ray's career.

In 1987, she appeared both in "The Night Stalker" and "Beverly Hills Cop II," starring <a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a>.

The next year, she appeared in "I Love 1980's" as herself followed by an appearance in "Never Mind the Buzzcocks" in 2002.</p><p>She then took another extended break from the spotlight throughout much of the 2000s and 2010s.

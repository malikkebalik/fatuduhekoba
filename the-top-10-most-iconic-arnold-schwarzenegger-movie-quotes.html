So, on Christmas Eve, he travels all over town to find the figurine and heads towards the Wintertainment Parade, which features Turbo Man in the flesh.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>This hilarious line is in reference to a scene in which Howard calls home to check in on his family. When his neighbor, Ted, answers the phone while enjoying Howard’s wife’s cookies in a suggestive manner, Howard is enraged and yells at Ted, “Put that cookie down, now!” Arnold’s over-the-top acting makes this line memorable and a fantastic way to tease any cookie monster friends you might have.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. “Consider that a divorce.” – Total Recall</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=858 data-injectable=true>Douglas Quaid wanted what we all want — to have virtual memories of a pseudo-vacation on Mars implanted in his mind. Instead, it triggered actual memories of him being a secret agent in a fight against the wicked Mars administrator, Cohaagen. He discovers that his entire life is a false memory planted in his brain and that the people who replaced his memories now want him dead. The answers that Quaid is searching for can only be found on Mars. There he gets involved in a coup against an evil regime. All in a day’s work when you’re Arnold.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>The line that Arnold delivers is during a scene in which Quaid fights with his fake wife, Lori (Sharon Stone), who was placed with him to solidify the lie that was his life. After Lori tries to appeal to Quaid’s humanity, she goes for her gun, and Quaid shoots her in the head, killing her. If that’s not grounds for divorce, what is?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. “Let’s kick some ice!” – Batman and Robin</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Batman and Robin work together to defeat the villains of Gotham City.

The Ice Age!” as well as, “Always winterize your pipes.” Perhaps the most memorable is Arnold shouting, “Let’s kick some ice!”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. “It’s not a tumor!” – Kindergarten Cop</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>In this family-friendly role, Arnold plays police officer John Kimble who goes undercover as a teacher.

After Sarah survived, John, now a young boy, teams up with another, identical T-800. This time he must fend off an advanced Terminator, the T-1000, who is sent back in time to assassinate John. Luckily, Arnold is on his side, and its mission is to save John rather than kill him.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>A significant part of the movie is the relationship that blossoms between John and The Terminator. This includes John attempting to teach his robot protector cool catchphrases he can use while destroying foes, such as “Hasta la vista, baby!”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. “I’ll be back.” – The Terminator</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Kyle Reese, a soldier from a post-apocalyptic world where machines have destroyed humanity, is sent into the past to protect Sarah Connor, the future mother of the man who will save the world.

Together, Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese must evade The Terminator and save the world.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>The catchphrase has been used in many of Arnold’s movies, including The Running Man, Commando, and Total Recall. However, it is most associated with the Terminator franchise, and rightfully so, as in this movie, it’s delivered with such finesse by Arnold as to make it one of the most well-known movie quotes of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6ioXWZ9bq7ErKtmmaKjvK2wjKyaoa%2BRp8emusSgnp6qXaK8t7XEZqiup6SawHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-does-maneet-chauhan-own-celebrity.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Does Maneet Chauhan Own?

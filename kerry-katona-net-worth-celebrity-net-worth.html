This tax bill was for £82,000 which was nothing to me at that time…. The money had all gone. I was completely ripped off and conned, I trusted the wrong people… I was doing drugs, I wasn't in the right frame of mind, I entrusted them with my money so it is my responsibility as well.</strong>"</p><h2 id=onlyfans-earnings><strong>OnlyFans Earnings</strong></h2><p>In mid-2021 Kerry Katona joined OnlyFans.

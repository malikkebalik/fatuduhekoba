However, she admits she did have a moment where she wasn’t fond of saying the same lines repeatedly:</p><p>It was something that I always wanted to do, from a very young age, which is why I was a four-year-old that had my first acting job. I was fortunate enough to grow up on a set, and I told my parents, ‘I really want to do what the actors are doing.’ They were kind enough to create a role for me and let me experience it, and I did, but I came back, and I was like, ‘I don’t know if I want to do that. It’s boring and you make me say lines, over and over again.’ They didn’t put any pressure on me to be an actor.</p><p id=par-6_24>Bellisario says the acting bug bit her again when she was a teenager. That’s when she decided to seek representation and formally study acting:</p><p>&nbsp;It wasn’t until I was a teenager that I came back to [my parents] and said, ‘Hey, I was a four-year-old, and now I have no problem with doing multiple takes. I really want to be an actor.’ And they said, ‘Okay, great! So, what are you going to do about it?’ That was when I went out and sought representation, and then I realized that I didn’t know anything about the craft.</p><p>I had actors that I really admired, and I noticed that they all studied in the theater, so that was when I started applying to theater schools and wanted to get an education and build my craft. It wasn’t until my junior year in college when my dad finally said to me, after seeing me in a play, ‘You know what? Maybe you can actually do this.’</p><h2>Troian Bellisario’s net worth</h2><p id=par-7_19>As of this writing, Troian Bellisario has a net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth estimates.</p><h2>What’s next for Troian Bellisario</h2><p id=par-8_25>It was recently announced that Bellisario will star in the CBS television series Ways & Means, alongside Grey’s Anatomy alum Patrick Dempsey, the show’s executive producer.</p><p id=par-9_3>Follow Sheiresa <a href=#>@SheiresaNgo</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBs7vImqVmmpWhuaq%2FwKugqGWemsFuw86rq6FmmKm6rXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tyler-perry-is-extremely-rich-but-not-quite-a-billionaire-yet.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tyler Perry Is Extremely Rich But Not Quite A Billionaire, Yet</a>

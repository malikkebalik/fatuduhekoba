She was unhappy with Christine Brown leaving Kody Brown and with the poor statuses of Janelle and Meri’s unions with him as well.</p><p id=par-3_76>However, as the season unfolded, Robyn acted as if she didn’t know or understand Christine’s reasons for leaving their clan in the infamous “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">knife in the kidneys</a>” episode. “In Vegas? That’s a lie. I remember the conversations and I remember what was going on. I remember you guys having fun dates and hearing about that, and seeing your guys’ relationship. So either you guys were faking it in front of me. I don’t know,” Robyn defended.</p><p id=par-4_31>But that wasn’t the worst of it. During the season’s One-on-One episodes, Robyn shared her thoughts about the demise of her <a href=#>fellow sister wives’ relationships</a> with Kody. Her statements were bristling.</p><p id=par-5_24>Robyn told show host Sukanya Krishnan the women’s relationships with Kody deteriorated because they didn’t “take care” of them. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People Magazine</a> reported her comments.</p><p id=par-6_46>“He’s had wives reject him, affection-wise because they are uncomfortable or they don’t like it. That’s not who they are,” she said in an <a href=#>ick-factor moment</a>. “I’m sorry, but if you’re rejecting someone’s affection, your spouse, I don’t see how that’s going to help your relationship.”</p><p id=par-7_52>She continued, “If you’re sitting there constantly nagging at your husband about what you didn’t get, even though you have this apple in your hand but really want her orange, then how is he supposed to feel when you see what he’s doing for you? How is he supposed to feel appreciated?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kody-brown-robyn-brown.jpg><p id=par-8_29>During Sister Wives‘ earlier seasons, Robyn Brown’s spitfire personality was apparent. She was not shy about sharing her thoughts during the series’ many confessionals, which aired during each episode.</p><p id=par-9_48>As time progressed, Robyn’s demeanor changed. She became more soft-spoken and appeared, for the most part, clueless about the shift in the family dynamic. But she likely knew well enough about the issues Kody was having with each wife as he spent the most time at her home.</p><p id=par-10_19>She also asserted she can “speak Kody.” Surprisingly, some of his wives fed into that narrative, until they didn’t.</p><p id=par-11_34>For 16 years, Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown lived exclusively with Kody. Therefore, they became experts on navigating his moods and knew when the right time was and was not to approach tough topics.</p><p id=par-12_28>But, as the newest wife, Robyn took it upon herself to become the Kody whisperer. Subsequently, Christine and Janelle spoke out about her claims she knew him best.</p><p id=par-13_37>Christine stated during the same <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One-on-One</a> episodes, “I met him when I was 18. I’ve known Kody for a long time, and I can actually read Kody pretty well. And I can speak Kody well, too.”</p><p id=par-14_34>Janelle said in a different talking head, “I’m like, ‘Well, I don’t know if I really need someone to translate for me. We’ve been married for a long time. We did OK without you.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robyn-continues-to-show-kody-who-s-boss>Robyn continues to show Kody who’s boss</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-15_33>In a special Sister Wives episode focusing on Christine Brown’s wedding to David Wooley, Robyn and Kody Brown were seen in a confessional. They <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about the wedding</a>, which they weren’t invited to.</p><p id=par-16_40>During their commentary, Kody spoke about Christine, their relationship, and her marriage to David. However, Robyn took the reins and showed Kody who was the boss in their relationship, as he continued to speak on the topic of Christine’s marriage.</p><p id=par-17_40>“I knew David and Christine were going to get married. I saw a wedding announcement at my sister’s house,” Kody said. “So, [it] was kind of curious to me that some of my family had been invited to the wedding.”</p><p id=par-18_25>“She made the accusation that I had,” Kody began in a second statement. Robyn stopped him by saying, “Aren’t we just so happy for them?”</p><p id=par-19_37>Kody kept talking while Robyn took the reins, stating, “We’re just so happy for them, right? That’s what we want.” Then, she sealed her commentary with a kiss as a way to get Kody to stop talking.</p><p id=par-20_19>Sister Wives is currently on hiatus. The series airs on TLC, and <a href=#>Season 19</a> will air sometime in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqr%2FTnqlmr5mrsrR50aiZsqZdl7%2Bww81moJyjXZuupMDOq2SippOnsqK%2FxKxkrKSRosBussSlo6ivXay2t7HSZqmeopWYwaq6xmaiqJypqHqissWemq2hn6N7qcDMpWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./townes-adair-jones-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>&#171;&nbsp;Townes Adair Jones Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a>

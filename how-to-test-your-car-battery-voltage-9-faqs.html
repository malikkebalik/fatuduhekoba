Car batteries typically provide these 12.6 volts through six cells, each supplying around 2.1V.&nbsp;</p><p>When the engine is running, the batterys voltage should fall between 13.7-14.7V.&nbsp;</p><p>But what does the voltage tell you?</p><p>Measuring the resting voltage can indicate the battery’s<strong> state of charge</strong> — or how much battery charge capacity remains.&nbsp;<br>In general, for a car battery with 12 volts, the state of charge is:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>75% at 12.4V</li><li>50% at 12.2V</li><li>25% at 12.0V</li><li>Considered fully discharged at 11.9 minimum voltage.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you’re curious as to whether 8 x 1.5V AA batteries are the same as the 12 volts in a car battery, the answer is <strong>no</strong>. AA batteries have too much internal resistance to kick-start a car.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, let’s look at a simple battery test for voltage measurements.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=measure-battery><strong>How To Measure </strong><strong>Car Battery Voltage</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>To check your car’s battery condition, you’ll need a battery tester, like a simple <a href=#>voltmeter</a> or <a href=#>multimeter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For measuring the battery voltage and load, the multimeter has two probes: red and black. The red probe is for contact on the positive terminal, and the black probe is for the negative terminal.&nbsp;</p><p>Follow these six simple steps to measure the battery voltage:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-safety-measures>Safety Measures</h3><p>Before you begin your battery test, here are a couple of pointers for safety and accuracy:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Check the </strong><strong>battery </strong><strong>for </strong><a href=#><strong>leakage, bloating, or damage</strong></a> — don’t work on the battery if the terminals are damaged. An AGM battery will ensure that no leakage can occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Don’t smoke around batteries</strong>, as sparks can trigger an explosion.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Wear safety glasses and gloves</strong> to protect yourself from battery acid in case of any mishaps.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: For a more accurate reading, it’s best to do a battery test 12 hours after turning off your vehicle. This allows any surface charge to dissipate. Otherwise, your readings could be higher than they should be.</p><p>Once that’s done, here’s what you need to do:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=off-ignition>1. Turn Off The Ignition</h3><p>Make sure your vehicle’s ignition is off.&nbsp;</p><p>To help remove the surface charge, you can turn on the headlights for 2 minutes. Ensure the headlights are switched off before you test the battery capacity.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=measure-DC>2. Set Up The Tester To Measure DC&nbsp;</h3><p>Set your voltmeter or multimeter setting to test DC or DC voltage (Direct Current Voltage).&nbsp;<br>If there’s a DC voltage range, set the maximum to read around 20-25V.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=probe-terminal>3. Touch The Probes To Each Battery Terminal&nbsp;</h3><p>Locate the positive terminal (+) and the negative terminal (-) on the battery.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes the battery post is covered with a plastic cap. You’ll have to uncover the terminal to test, but you won’t have to remove the battery cables.&nbsp;</p><p>Your battery tester will likely have a red (+) and black (-) probe:</p><ul><li>First, touch the red probe (+) to the positive battery terminal&nbsp;</li><li>Then, touch the black probe (-) to the negative battery terminal&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you get a negative reading, it means your probes are swapped, and you just need to switch the battery post they’re touching.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=engine-off>4. Check Voltage With Engine Off</h3><p>A good battery should have a resting voltage between <strong>12.4-12.9V</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>If the <strong>reading is less than 12.4V,</strong> it doesn’t necessarily mean you have a bad lead acid battery, just low voltage. <a href=#>Some electrical system might have drained it</a>, or your alternator has trouble charging.&nbsp;</p><p>If the <strong>battery voltage</strong><strong> is below 12.2V</strong>, it needs to be recharged. Try driving your vehicle for at least 15 minutes to bring the low voltage back up. Alternatively, you can buy car battery chargers to charge the battery back to its minimum voltage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After recharging the low voltage battery, test it again to see if it holds the charge.&nbsp;</p><p>If the<strong> </strong><strong>batterys voltage</strong><strong> is over 12.9V,</strong> then your car battery has excessive voltage. Turn on your high beam to drain it. This could mean your alternator had overcharging issues.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>An AGM battery may display a higher voltage. Check the manufacturer datasheet for details.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=crank-test>5. Do A Crank Cycle Test&nbsp;</h3><p>The crank cycle test shows how well the battery performs when delivering voltage to the starter motor.&nbsp;</p><p>Get a friend (or use a remote starter if you have one) to start the car.&nbsp;</p><p>There’ll be a quick voltage drop as the engine is cranking, and then it will rise again. The <strong>voltage drop</strong><strong> shouldn’t go under 9.6V.</strong> If it does, it means the battery doesn’t have enough turnover strength, and you’ll likely need a new battery.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=engine-on>6. Measure Voltage With Engine On</h3><p>With the engine on, your vehicle will idle, maintaining a steady draw from the battery.&nbsp;</p><p>The alternator will now charge the car battery.&nbsp;</p><p>You can expect to see the<strong> battery voltage </strong><strong>measure around 13.7-14.7V.</strong> If the voltage reading is significantly lower or higher, it could mean issues with the battery or alternator.</p><p>But what if you don’t have a volt meter?&nbsp;<br>Can you still check your battery condition?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=check-tester><strong>How To The Check </strong><strong>Car Battery</strong><strong> Without A Tester</strong></h2><p>While you can’t accurately measure voltage without a tester, you can still gauge the car’s battery condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what to do:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>With the engine off, turn on the headlights — they will be your test indicator&nbsp;</li><li>Get a friend to start the car (or use a remote starter)</li><li>Watch the headlights as the engine cranks</li></ul><p>If the<strong> headlights dim</strong> during cranking, there might not be enough battery charge.</p><p>If the <strong>headlights remain steady,</strong> but the engine won’t start, then there’s no battery issue, but possibly a problem with the starter motor.&nbsp;</p><p>What about the alternator?<br>Is there a way to check it too?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=check-altenator><strong>How To Check The </strong><strong>Alternator</strong></h2><p>The <a href=#>alternator</a> is part of your vehicle’s charging system.&nbsp;<br>Here’s how to check if it’s working fine:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-with-a-tester>A. With A Tester</h3><p>With the engine running, <strong>turn on</strong> all the vehicle’s electronics — headlights, interior lamps, stereo, etc. — to maximize the voltage load.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, measure the battery voltage.&nbsp;</p><p>If the charging <strong>voltage drop is under 13.5V</strong>, it means the alternator has trouble charging the car battery, and you should <a href=#>get a mechanic to look at it.</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-b-without-a-tester>B. Without A Tester</h3><p>If you don’t have a tester handy, you can still test the alternator.&nbsp;<br>Make sure the car is “Park” and the parking brake is on before you begin.</p><p>Start the engine <strong>without</strong> the headlights, then turn on the headlights:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If the <strong>headlights are dimmer than usual</strong>, there might not be enough charging voltage from the alternator, so the headlights are running off sole battery power.</li></ul><p>Now, rev the engine:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If the <strong>headlights brighten</strong>, the alternator is charging the car battery but not providing enough voltage at idle.&nbsp;</li><li>If the <strong>headlights remain the same</strong>, then there’s probably no alternator issue.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Turn on the interior lights:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If they <strong>dim gradually </strong>with a running engine, there could be an alternator problem. <a href=#>Get a mechanic</a> to verify the issue.</li></ul><p>Now let’s go over some FAQs about car battery voltage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=voltage-faqs><strong>9 </strong><strong>Car Battery Voltage</strong><strong> FAQs</strong></h2><p>Here are answers to some common car battery questions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-voltmeter>1. What’s A Voltmeter?</h3><p>The voltmeter (or volt meter) is a simple instrument for measuring the electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. Electric potential difference refers to the electromotive force of the battery.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-multimeter>2. What’s A Multimeter?</h3><p>The multimeter measures multiple electrical properties — typically voltage (Volt), resistance (Ohms), and current (Amps). It’s sometimes called a Volt Ohm Milliammeter (VOM).&nbsp;</p><p>It is used to test if your battery has low or excessive voltage.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use a digital multimeter or an analog multimeter.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-altenator>3. What’s The Alternator?</h3><p>The alternator converts mechanical energy from the engine into electrical current for the car battery. It’s the primary element in your vehicle’s charging system.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, the alternator produces more current at higher speeds which means that driving faster will produce more current.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a cap, of course, on how much current the alternator can generate.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-how-often-should-i-test-battery-voltage>4. How Often Should I Test Battery Voltage?</h3><p>You should check your battery voltage at least<strong> twice annually.</strong> This will give you an idea of its condition, so you’ll know when to bring it for further testing or if you need a battery replacement.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-when-should-i-use-a-car-battery-charger>5. When Should I Use A Car Battery Charger?</h3><p>Hook your battery to car battery chargers if the voltmeter reading dips under 12.4V.&nbsp;</p><p>If the reading is below 12.2V, you should consider using a trickle charger which charges at a much slower rate. Using a trickle charger helps avoid the risk of battery overheating and overcharging.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-what-s-a-car-battery-load-test>6. What’s A Car Battery Load Test?</h3><p>The battery load test is used to test the 12 volt battery under load and is a more accurate battery health indicator than voltage measurement.</p><p>A load tester is specifically designed to determine the voltage generated while a load is placed on the fully charged battery.&nbsp;</p><p>During this test, the fully charged battery should be loaded with one-half of its cold cranking amp (CCA) rating at 70°F (or more.) A cold cranking amp refers to the battery’s ability to start in cold temperatures.</p><p>A good battery will be able to maintain 9.6V for 15 seconds with this load. If the load tester dips below 9.6V during the load test, it might be time for a battery replacement.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-how-do-i-know-if-i-have-a-bad-battery>7. How Do I Know If I Have A Bad Battery?</h3><p>A bad battery can display several symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some common ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Engine cranking is slow:</strong> this means the battery has difficulty delivering a charge&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A misshapen </strong><strong>battery</strong><strong>:</strong> it’s bloated, cracked, or leaking</li><li><strong>There’s an odd smell:</strong> this can come from leaking battery acid in a lead acid battery</li><li><strong>It’s an </strong><a href=#><strong>old </strong><strong>battery</strong></a><strong>:</strong> the average battery life is around 3-5 years</li></ul><p>If you notice any of these, it’s time to get a new battery.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=drain-out>8. Why Does A Car Battery Drain Out?</h3><p>Here are some reasons why you might have a dead battery after your engine is off:</p><ul><li>The headlights were left on</li><li>An electrical system (like a cell phone left charging) may be drawing amps&nbsp;</li><li>The <a href=#>battery isn’t being recharged</a> while you’re driving</li><li>The battery is too old and won’t hold a charge anymore</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-how-can-i-maximize-my-battery-life>9. How Can I Maximize My Battery Life?&nbsp;</h3><p>Here are a few methods you can use to increase battery capacity:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep the </strong><strong>battery </strong><strong>clean</strong>: Corrosion buildup can drastically decrease the life of a lead acid battery.</li><li><strong>Check electrolyte level</strong>: Remove the vent plugs and ensure that the electrolyte level covers the lead battery plates in all six cells.</li><li><strong>Recharge your </strong><strong>battery </strong><strong>every three months</strong>: Recharging with the appropriate car battery charger can maintain peak battery performance for longer periods of time.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=easy-solution>10.

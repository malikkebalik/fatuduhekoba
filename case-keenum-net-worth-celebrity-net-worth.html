id=what-case-keenum8217s-net-worth><strong>What is Case Keenum's Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Case Keenum is an American professional football player who has a net worth of $25 million. Case Keenum went undrafted in 2012 but eventually signed with the Houson Texans where he played from 2012 to 2013. He played for the St. Louis Rams and the Houston Texans in 2014. Keenum played for the St. Louis / Los Angeles Rams from 2015 to 2016 and for the Minnesota Vikings in 2017. He played for the Denver Broncos in 2018, joined the Washington Redskins in 2019 and the Buffalo Bills in 2022. In 2018 he signed a two year $36 million deal with the Broncos. Before the NFL Keenum was a star college football player at Houston, where he became the NCAA's all-time leader in total touchdowns, passing yards, and completions.</p><h2 id=early-life-high-school><strong>Early Life and High School</strong></h2><p>Case Keenum was born on February 17, 1988 in Brownwood, Texas. His father, Steve, formerly served as an offensive lineman at McMurry University, where he later became head football coach and athletic director. Keenum was raised in Alpine and Abilene, and went to Wylie High School in the latter city. On the football team there, he passed for 6,783 yards and 48 touchdowns, and rushed for 41 touchdowns and 2,000 yards. Keenum finished his high school career with a 31-11 record. In addition to football, he was also a varsity basketball and track athlete.</p><h2 id=collegiate-career><strong>Collegiate Career</strong></h2><p>For college, Keenum was recruited by the University of Houston to play football with the Houston Cougars. During his freshman season in 2006, he redshirted. Keenum made his debut collegiate appearance the next year in the season opener against Oregon. He went on to have an impressive season, finishing with 2,259 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions. Keenum performed even better in 2008, when he became only the second player in school history to complete more than 5,000 passing yards in a single season. Moreover, he led the nation in total offense, and helped Houston claim its first bowl game in nearly 30 years. Keenum continued his formidable playing in 2009, leading the Cougars to a 10-4 record. He finished with 48 total touchdowns and more than 5,800 total offensive yards.</p><p>Despite an auspicious start to the 2010 season, Keenum was sidelined after tearing his ACL in the third game of the season. He graduated at the end of the year with a BA in business administration. However, Keenum returned in 2011 after the NCAA gave him a sixth year of eligibility. That October, he set a new NCAA record for passing touchdowns, with nine. The following month, he set new NCAA records for career passing yards and career completions.</p><h2 id=houston-texans><strong>Houston Texans</strong></h2><p>Despite his great collegiate success, Keenum went undrafted in 2012. He ended up signing with the Houston Texans and serving with the team's practice squad for his whole rookie season. Keenum finally saw play in 2013, throwing his first NFL touchdown in his October debut against the Kansas City Chiefs. However, his season was underwhelming, marked by a 0-8 record as a starter.</p><p>In 2014, Keenum was waived by the Texans. He was immediately claimed by the St. Louis Rams, but was then waived by that team a couple months later. Keenum ended the year re-signing with the Texans and winning his first two NFL games.</p><h2 id=st-louis-los-angeles-rams><strong>St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams</strong></h2><p>In early 2015, Keenum returned to the Rams. After suffering a concussion late in the season, he led the team to three consecutive victories. Keenum finished the season with 828 yards and four touchdowns across six games. In 2016, after the Rams had moved back to Los Angeles, Keenum set a new team record for consecutive completions, with 19.</p><h2 id=minnesota-vikings><strong>Minnesota Vikings</strong></h2><p>Keenum signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings in 2017. He went on to have one of his best NFL seasons ever with the team. Among the highlights of the regular season, he helped the Vikings win six consecutive games. For November, he was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month. Keenum finished the regular season with 3,547 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. The Vikings ultimately won the NFC North Division, and beat the New Orleans Saints in dramatic fashion in the divisional round. However, the team then fell to the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-287382 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/case.jpg alt="Case Keenum" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-287382 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=denver-broncos><strong>Denver Broncos</strong></h2><p>In 2018, Keenum signed with the Denver Broncos. His highlight of the season came in Week 5 when he recorded a new career high of 377 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Keenum finished the season with a career high of 3,890 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.</p><h2 id=washington-redskins><strong>Washington Redskins</strong></h2><p>Keenum was traded to the Washington Redskins in 2019. In Week 1, he posted a new career high throwing for 380 yards and three touchdowns. Keenum ultimately played ten games during the season, amassing 1,707 yards, 11 touchdowns, and five interceptions.</p><h2 id=cleveland-browns><strong>Cleveland Browns</strong></h2><p>In 2020, Keenum signed a three-year contract with the Cleveland Browns. He ended up playing for two years with the team, during which time he had solid but unremarkable performances.</p><h2 id=buffalo-bills><strong>Buffalo Bills</strong></h2><p>Keenum was traded to the Buffalo Bills in 2022. As a result, he was reunited with his former Minnesota Vikings teammate Stefon Diggs, with whom he performed the "Minneapolis Miracle" in the 2018 NFC divisional round.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>With his wife Kimberly, Keenum has a child. Among his other endeavors, he is a part-owner of Haak Winery in Santa Fe, Texas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6e4jpyYrJ1doLKmutSmZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./richard-widmark-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Richard Widmark Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
